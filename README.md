# detached-head
Let's play with detached HEAD <br/>
A detached HEAD occurs when you are viewing a single commit in the history of a git repository. You'll see a message whenever you enter into detached HEAD state informing you that you are no longer on a branch.
The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit you made or the last commit that was checked out into your working directory. That also means it will be he parent of the next commit you do.
