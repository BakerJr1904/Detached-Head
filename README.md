# Detached Head
### Let's play with detached HEAD <br/>

A detached HEAD occurs when you are viewing a single commit in the history of a git repository. You'll see a message 

whenever you enter into detached HEAD state informing you that you are no longer on a branch.

The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit you made or 

the last commit that was checked out into your working directory.<br/>

That also means it will be the parent of the next commit you do.<br/>

What is the Origin (or Remote Head) in Git? The word origin is an alias that Git created to replace the remote URL of a remote repository. In summary, origin/HEAD represents the default branch on the remote, which is defined automatically when you clone a repository from the internet.
